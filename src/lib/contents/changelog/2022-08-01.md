Users of the latest release could notice that we were working on improvements to VS Code Browser and Desktop.
Now they are available in stable release as well via VS Code settings. Key highlights are:

- **[Connection improvements for VS Code Desktop](#connection-improvements-for-vs-code-desktop)** to bring stability and performance.
- **[New ports explorer in VS Code Browser](#new-ports-explorer-in-vs-code-browser)** to align interface with VS Code Desktop.
- **[Latest changelog view in VS Code](#latest-changelog-view-in-vs-code)** to access the latest changelog directly from VS Code Browser or Desktop.

> You can enable `Latest Release` in [your preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) and try the latest updates as soon as they are available.

### Connection improvements for VS Code Desktop

We developed a new SSH connection mode for VS Code Desktop which brings stability and performance improvements.
This mode can be enabled by setting `gitpod.remote.useLocalApp` to `false` in VS Code settings and will be enabled by default in future releases.

You can learn more about new the approach in its announcement [blog post](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/vscode-desktop-ssh-updates). If you're short of time:

1. Connection has improved stability, with fewer disconnections
2. Approach doesn't overwrite the [`remote.SSH.configFile`](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/10/03/remote-ssh-tips-and-tricks#_ssh-configuration-file)
3. No additional binary downloads required or background processes
4. Fewer requests from VS Code to accept the SSH fingerprint
5. Improved operating system support via OpenSSH

### New ports explorer in VS Code Browser

We developed a new ports explorer in VS Code Browser to align the interface with VS Code Desktop.
This feature can be enabled by setting `gitpod.experimental.portsView.enabled` to `true` in VS Code settings.
Give it a try and weâ€™d love to hear [your feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7408).

### Latest changelog view in VS Code

The new VS Code command `Gitpod: Show Release Notes` let you access latest changelog directly from VS Code Browser or Desktop.
